      <h1>file uploader</h1>
      <p>A simple <strong>file uploader</strong>. Files can be either <strong>browsed</strong> or <strong>dragged and dropped</strong>. Files are posted via an  <strong>XMLHttpRequest</strong>. The <strong>progress</strong> is shown as percentage and graphically in the box. The server side saves the files with the <strong>fs module</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>Maximum size for each upload: 5 MB.</strong> The files are <strong>not stored on a permanent drive</strong>, therefore they can disappear easily. A solution for this would be uploading the files to an <strong>AWS S3 storage</strong>, which will be implemented soon.</p>
