              <h4>University</h4>
              <p>I graduated as a Chemical Engineer from the Technical University of Budapest specializing on Analytical Chemistry.</p>
              <p>Apart from the chemistry-related knowledge I gained there I am mostly grateful for the scientific mindset it gave and the practical approach to solve problems.</p>

            <h4>Pharmaceutical Industry</h4>
            <p>I started working in a Research & Development laboratory at Egis. This laboratory uses solid-state analysis techniques such as <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHMzFUo0NL8">X-ray Powder Diffraction</a>, <a href = "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40828-015-0008-y">Thermal Analysis</a>, or <a href = "https://www.nexus-analytics.com.my/how-does-laser-diffraction-work/">Laser-Diffaction</a> to determine and improve the properties of drugs.</p>
            <p>This requires requires good observation, precision, creativity and surprisingly, good communication skills to present your ideas on meetings, to keep contact with foreign authorities or to resolve disagreements with a supplier from India or China.</p>

            <h4>Learning to code</h4>
            <p>I first encountered programming near 2003 in the game <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colobot">Colobot</a>, where an object-oriented programming language syntactically similar to C++ and Java is used to program robots during a space mission. The programming concepts I learned there turned out to be quite useful later on. I also started studying Java from a <a href = "https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-java/">book</a>, although it felt to be too monotonous to find the motivation for it.</p>
            <p>The breakthrough was brought by a basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript course on <a href = "https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers">Coursera</a>. The instructs style made it easy to follow and it was quite rewarding to see my code lines transform into a visually   </p>
            <p>After a while I always came up with new ideas on what to create next and dug up the necessary documentations and tutorials until I was able to make it. It also helped to prove that I am able to learn by myself and to realise that knowledge is out there if you are willing to reach.</p>
            <p>Fortunately I also had a mentor, a professional tutor to consult from time to time about my progress and the issues I have encountered.</p>

            <h4>Hobbies</h4>
            <p>Whenever I have to opportunity I try to get out into the nature - whether it is a hike in the nearby mountains, going to somewhere further or just to sit by a lake with a friend. I also like travelling, I have been to some places. Music is my other passion, I often visit live music events mostly from the underground scene. I have also experimented with woodturning and woodworking.</p>
