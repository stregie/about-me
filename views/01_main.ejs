        <p>I started coding by myself in January of 2021</p>
        <p>First, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, then moved on to Node.js</p>
        <p>The purpose of the site is to demonstrate what I am capable of</p>

      <h1>about the site</h1>
      <div>
        <p>The site is responsive, I used <a href = "https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/">Bootstrap v4.6</a>. For some parts I used native JavaScript, but I also used the <a href = "https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> library. Backend was written in <a href = "https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> using <a href = "http://expressjs.com/">Express 4</a>. The templating language is <a href = "http://ejs.co">EJS</a>. I used <a href = "https://github.com/stregie/heroku-about-me">GitHub</a> for version controlling. The site is deployed on Heroku (obviously). The MySQL server I use is <a href = "https://www.cleardb.com/">ClearDB</a> and for no-SQL database I use <a href = "https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>.</p>
        <p>Each site in the 'things I can do' section represents a different skill. Neither of them was created by following a step-by-step tutorial.
        <p>The next improvement will be a sign in / out feature using <a href = "http://www.passportjs.org/">Passport.js</a> to restrict the news editor for authenticated users only. I also plan to learn the basics of Angular or React and later on Python.</p>
