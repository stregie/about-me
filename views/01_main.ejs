        <p>I started coding by myself in January of 2021</p>
        <p>First, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, then moved on to Node.js</p>
        <p>The purpose of the site is to demonstrate what I am capable of</p>

      <h1>about the site</h1>
      <div>
        <p>The site is responsive, I used <strong>Bootstrap v4.6</strong>. For some parts I used native <strong>JavaScript</strong>, but I also used the <strong>jQuery</strong> library. Backend was written in <strong>Node.js</strong> using <strong>Express 4</strong>. The templating language is <strong>EJS</strong>. I used <strong>GitHub</strong> for version controlling. The site is deployed on <strong>Heroku</strong> (obviously). The <strong>MySQL</strong> server I use is <strong>ClearDB</strong> and for <strong>no-SQL</strong> database I use <strong>MongoDB</strong>.</p>
        <p>Each site in the 'things I can do' section represents a different skill. Neither of them was created by following a step-by-step tutorial. The next improvement will be a sign in / out feature using <strong>Passport.js</strong> to restrict the news editor for authenticated users only.</p>
        <p>Currently I am learning <strong>React</strong>, also plan to learn the basics of <strong>Angular</strong> and later on, <strong>Python</strong>.</p>
