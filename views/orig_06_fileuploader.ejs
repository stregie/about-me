      <h1>file uploader</h1>
      <p>A simple <strong>file uploader</strong>. Files can be either <strong>browsed</strong> or <strong>dragged and dropped</strong>. Files are posted via an  <strong>XMLHttpRequest</strong>. The <strong>progress</strong> is shown as percentage and graphically in the box. The server side saves the files with the <strong>fs module</strong>.</p>
      <p>Right now it does not work properly as Cyclic does not support the storage of permanent files. The new version integrating cloud storage on <strong>AWS S3</strong> is currently under construction.</p>
